# Chocofi Keyboard Layout (_Currently WIP_)

The [chocofi](https://github.com/pashutk/chocofi) is a next gen keyboard by Pavel Glushkov. It's split, column staggered, hotswappable, has 36 keys, and uses choc switches. This repo contains my zmk config for my personal non-qwerty layout. I bought the keyboard [here](https://shop.beekeeb.com/product/chocofi-36-keys-kailh-low-profile-choc-v1-mechanical-ergonomic-hotswap-split-keyboard-diy-kit/).
